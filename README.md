# noop

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/wheelercj/noop.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wheelercj/noop)

A calculator with no operators.

All digits are added together. Only single-character numbers can be used, including Roman numeral characters. If the input has a period, the digits to its left are negative.

## why?

If you only need addition and subtraction, this way is sometimes faster. The home and end keys help a lot when you're switching between positive and negative numbers.
